# CIIC 3011: Intro to Computer Programming course projects

This repository contains the three projects completed for the course. These were written in Python. The projects are:

 1. Unit Conversion Program (`MaldonadoSebastian_086_P1C.py`, Sept. 2019) 
    - The program lets the user convert between some of the units of the metric and imperial system.
 2. HTML Resources Parser (`MaldonadoSebastian_086_P2C.py`, Oct. 2019 to Nov. 2019)
    -  Program that parses an HTML file and finds all of the internal resources used by that file, the results must then be saved in an output file, which would then be used as a guide to know all of the files that need to be removed.
 3. HTML Resources Parser 2.0 (`MaldonadoSebastian_086_P3C.py`, Nov. 2019)
    - Program that parses an HTML file and finds all of the internal resources used by that file, the results must then be saved in an output file, which would then be used as a guide to know all of the files that need to be removed (this time integrating python dictionaries).
 4. Extra projects and documents (`extras/`)
    - Includes two additional optional course projects, and the `.html` used for programs 2 and 3.

Technical skills gained include:

 - usage and implementation of functions and control structures in Python
 - applying programming control structures and different data structures
 - creation of computational artifacts
 - processing of text files in Python
