### *Intro to Computer Programming class projects*
This repository contains the three projects done in class. These were written in Python.  
Projects are:  
>1. Unit Conversion Program (**MaldonadoSebastian_086_P1C.py**, Sept. 2019)  
>>- The program lets the user convert between some of the units of the metric and imperial system.
>2. HTML Resources Parser (**MaldonadoSebastian_086_P2C.py**, Oct. 2019 to Nov. 2019)  
>>- Program that parses an HTML file and finds all of the internal resources used by that file, the results must then be saved in an output file, which would then be used as a guide to know all of the files that need to be removed.
>3. HTML Resources Parser 2.0 (**MaldonadoSebastian_086_P3C.py**, Nov. 2019)
>>- Program that parses an HTML file and finds all of the internal resources used by that file, the results must then be saved in an output file, which would then be used as a guide to know all of the files that need to be removed (this time integrating python dictionaries).
